A new way to make images responsive

The entire Idea of this is to make the website as responsive as possible. Here the Images will resize themselves in form of columns of a specific width regardless the size of the image. I have used random images from google instead of custom images to prove this point.
The images automatically resize themselves asper the  size of the screen.
